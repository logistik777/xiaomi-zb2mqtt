=================

### To run the bridge

* Install
```sh  
$ git clone https://github.com/starkun/xiaomi-zb2mqtt.git  
$ cd xiaomi-zb2mqtt  
/xiaomi-zb2mqtt$ npm install  
```
* Configuration: for the moment you have to edit index.js and set your serial port and mqtt broker.
```
var client  = mqtt.connect('mqtt://localhost') //write your mqtt broker adress (ex. mqtt://192.168.0.1:1883,localhost)
var timers = {};
var shepherd = new ZShepherd('/dev/ttyACM0',  //write adress of USB device cc25xx
```
* Run it
```sh  
/xiaomi-zb2mqtt$ node index.js  
```

* To see whats happening behind the scenes run it with debug enabled:
```sh  
/xiaomi-zb2mqtt$ DEBUG=* node index.js  
```

### Notes
* You need CC2531 USB stick flashed with CC2531ZNP-Pro-Secure_LinkKeyJoin.hex from here: https://github.com/mtornblad/zstack-1.2.2a.44539/tree/master/CC2531
* Zigbee shepherd's pairing process can take quite a while (more than a minute).
* When pairing WXKG01LM, after reset you need to toggle (short keypress) the reset button every couple of seconds to keep the switch from going to sleep until the pairing is complete.
